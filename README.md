# Machine-Learning-Project-
This is the code for a Machine learning project I did at UCLA Last year 
Final Grade Recieved for the project was an A
Code is in R, the libraries in the beginning will need to be run.
I set the seed to 11895

An ROC Curve will need to be added, as well as a Confusion Matrix
